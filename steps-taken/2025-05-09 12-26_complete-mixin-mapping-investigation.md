## Step Summary

We have completed the investigation into using old RuneLite mixins and mapping files to identify obfuscated client hooks for player position tracking. The following was determined:

- The mixin structure provides method/field signatures but not the actual obfuscated names.
- Mapping files are not present in the checked-out source and are generated or fetched at build time, which failed due to missing dependencies.
- The best next step is to consider alternative, more robust approaches for client automation.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Try to hook into menu entry creation or processing.**
   - Inject into the method that builds or processes menu entries to detect interactable obstacles and trigger automation.
2. **If that fails, hook into the game tick or event dispatcher.**
   - Track player state and trigger actions at the right time.
3. **If both fail, fall back to input simulation or right-click injection.**
   - Use the agentâ€™s mouse input service or programmatically send right-clicks and select menu options as a last resort.

This step is now complete and the workspace is ready for a fresh approach to client automation.
