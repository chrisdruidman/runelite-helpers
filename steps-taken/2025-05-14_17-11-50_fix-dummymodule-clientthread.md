Resolved thread safety errors in DummyModule by ensuring all client API calls (addChatMessage) are scheduled on the RuneLite ClientThread using agentRegistry.getClientThread().invokeLater(...). Verified with a successful build and ready for runtime testing. All changes follow the modular registry and patch-based workflow requirements.
