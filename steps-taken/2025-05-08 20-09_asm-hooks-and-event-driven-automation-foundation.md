## Step: Integrate ASM hooks, HookingService, and event-driven automation foundation

-   Scaffolded and registered modular ASM transformers for player animation, player position, and object presence.
-   Implemented HookingService with static entry points, event dispatch, and synchronous state queries.
-   Updated GameStateService to use HookingService for real-time game state and event-driven logic.
-   Updated AgilityAutomationService to use GameStateService for robust, event-driven obstacle automation.
-   Ensured all code is modular, extensible, and ready for further automation logic.

This step provides a robust, event-driven foundation for automating agility rooftop courses and other RuneLite tasks.
