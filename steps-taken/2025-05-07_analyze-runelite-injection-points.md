## Step: Analyze RuneLite for Agent Injection Points

- Searched the RuneLite client source for input handling, event system, and game logic/tick management.
- Identified that input is managed by MouseManager, MouseListener, and KeyListener classes, with MouseManager registering listeners and processing mouse events.
- Determined that the event system is built around an EventBus, with @Subscribe-annotated methods in plugins and core systems to receive events.
- Found that game logic and tick handling are managed via GameTick (every 0.6s) and ClientTick (every 20ms) events, with the Hooks class implementing the Callbacks interface to post events to the EventBus.
- Concluded that the best injection points for automation are: subscribing to the EventBus for game events, hooking into MouseManager/KeyListener for input simulation, and optionally using the Callbacks interface or Hooks class for deeper integration.

This step provides a clear map of where and how to inject or listen for automation opportunities in the RuneLite client for the agent.
