## Step: Scaffold modular automation flow for Agility obstacle and menu interaction

-   Scaffolded AgilityObstacle class and updated CanifisCourse to provide an ordered obstacle list.
-   Added AgilityAutomationService for modular, extensible course automation logic.
-   Registered MenuEntryService for right-click menu interaction and injected it into AgilityAutomationService.
-   Updated AgentRegistry to manage all dependencies via constructor injection, ensuring strict modularity.
-   Refactored AgilityModule to be UI-agnostic and delegate automation to the service layer.

This step provides a robust, modular foundation for implementing obstacle automation logic and future extensibility.
