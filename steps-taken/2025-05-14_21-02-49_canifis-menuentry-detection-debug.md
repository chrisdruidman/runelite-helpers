# Step Complete: canifis-menuentry-detection-debug

**Date:** 2025-05-14_21-02-49
**Agent:** Mr. Gippity

Enabled per-tick logging of all menu entries in DummyModule. Confirmed that the menu entry for the Canifis Start Tree (object ID 10819) is present and detected when mousing over the obstacle. This validates the modular, patch-based approach for minimal API menu entry access and logging. All results are logged to both the chatbox and agent-output log. Step complete.
