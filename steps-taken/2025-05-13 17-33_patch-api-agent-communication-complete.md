# Step: Patch-Based API Agent Communication - Dummy Module Test

## Summary

-   The patch-based hybrid approach for agent-to-client communication was validated.
-   The custom launcher was updated to overwrite the downloaded `runelite-api-*.jar` with the patched version after artifact download and before client launch.
-   The agent's Dummy Module was updated to call `DummyApi.getTestString()` from the patched API and log the result.
-   The launcher now logs the overwrite action, and the client/agent both use the patched API at runtime.
-   Runtime test confirmed: enabling the Dummy Module logs `DummyApi.getTestString() result: dummy-api-success` with no errors.

## Outcome

-   Patch-based API communication is working as intended.
-   The agent and client are both modular and extensible, and the workflow is robust for future patch-based integrations.

This step is now complete and documented for future reference.
