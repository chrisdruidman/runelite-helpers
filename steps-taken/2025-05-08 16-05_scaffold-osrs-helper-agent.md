Agent: GitHub Copilot (Mr. Gippity)

## Step: Scaffold osrs-helper-agent modular structure

-   Created the main agent entry file (`OsrsHelperAgent.java`) with logging setup, premain/agentmain entry points, and log file clearing logic.
-   Added modular folders for `helpermodules`, `overlay`, and `services`, each with a placeholder file or README.
-   Implemented `AgentRegistry.java` to manage registration of services and modules, supporting modular and extensible architecture.
-   Verified that the new files have no errors and that the structure is ready for further development.

This step establishes a clean, extensible foundation for the agent, following all project and modularity requirements.
