**Agent:** Mr. Gippity

Completed modular, extensible anti-AFK logic in DummyModule. Mouse movement simulation is now disabled for safety; only tab switching, camera rotation, and keypress simulation (space, 1, 2, m) are used. All actions are randomized and logged. This step is complete and safe for further testing on non-main accounts. All changes follow the patch-based, modular workflow and are well documented. Agent: Mr. Gippity.
