Agent: GitHub Copilot (Mr. Gippity)

## Step: Build agent with ASM overlay injection

-   Successfully built the agent project using Maven, producing a shaded jar as required.
-   Confirmed that the ASM injection logic is in place to launch the overlay after RuneLite's main window is shown.
-   Added a log statement to OsrsHelperAgent.launchOverlay() to confirm ASM-injected calls at runtime.
-   Ensured all code remains modular, extensible, and separate from the RuneLite source.

This step confirms the agent can be built and is ready for runtime testing and further development.
