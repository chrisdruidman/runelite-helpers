# Step Complete: Integrate Agent Logic via Patch (2025-05-13)

**Agent:** GitHub Copilot (Mr. Gippity)
**Date:** 2025-05-13

## Summary

-   Successfully migrated agent logic into the RuneLite client source under `runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/helper/agent/`.
-   Updated all package declarations and imports to use the new namespace.
-   Generated a patch file (`osrs-helper-patches/osrs-helper-agent-integration.patch`) capturing all changes.
-   Verified patch file contains the expected content.
-   Successfully reset the RuneLite source and re-applied the patch, confirming the workflow is robust and repeatable.

**Next Steps:**

-   Build and test the client with the integrated agent logic.
-   Continue modular development and patch-based tracking for all future changes.
