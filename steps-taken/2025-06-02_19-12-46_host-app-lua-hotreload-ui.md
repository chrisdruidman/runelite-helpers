# Step Complete: host-app-lua-hotreload-ui

**Agent:** Mr. Gippity

Implemented modular, hot-reloadable host app for Lua scripting with Wails (Go/Lit). Scripts are now only run via UI controls, log polling is less aggressive, and log output is cleared on each run. Start/Stop buttons work as intended. Step complete as of 2025-06-02.
