## Step: Validate agent manifest and build configuration

-   Verified and updated the maven-shade-plugin configuration in pom.xml to set the correct Premain-Class (com.osrs.helper.agent.OsrsHelperAgent) in the shaded jar manifest.
-   Confirmed that the agent jar is now correctly built and recognized by the JVM for -javaagent injection.
-   Ensured all code and configuration remain modular, extensible, and separate from the RuneLite source.

This step confirms the agent build and manifest are correct, and the project is ready for further runtime testing and development.
