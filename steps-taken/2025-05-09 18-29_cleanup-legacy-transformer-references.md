# Step Summary: Cleanup Legacy Transformer References

## Description

All references to obsolete ASM transformer classes (`PlayerAnimationTransformer`, `PlayerPositionTransformer`, `ObjectPresenceTransformer`) and any legacy injected hook logic have been removed from the `osrs-helper-agent` codebase. The only remaining ASM/injected hook logic is in the overlay injection service, as required by the hybrid patch-based approach. All other agent modules, services, and helper logic now interact with RuneLite solely via the minimal API exposed by patch files.

## Actions Taken

-   Searched for and removed all imports, usages, and code referencing the deleted transformer classes.
-   Updated `OsrsHelperAgent.java` to remove transformer registration and imports.
-   Searched for and confirmed removal of any other legacy, ASM, or direct RuneLite references outside the overlay injection logic.
-   Verified that all agent code and documentation now strictly comply with the modular, patch-based design.

## Result

The codebase is now fully aligned with the project requirements: only the overlay uses injected hooks/ASM, and all other logic is modular, extensible, and interacts with RuneLite via the minimal API. No legacy or obsolete code remains.
