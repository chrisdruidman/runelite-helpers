Agent: GitHub Copilot (Mr. Gippity)

## Step: Scaffold and integrate overlay

-   Scaffolded OverlayWindow.java as a modular, extensible Java Swing overlay for module control, placed in the overlay folder.
-   Integrated the overlay into the agent startup so it appears automatically when the agent is loaded.
-   Confirmed that the overlay is ready for future module enable/disable controls and other options.

This step ensures the agent has a user interface foundation for modular control, following all project and modularity requirements.
