## Step: Modular Agent and Module Registration System

-   Implemented a modular system for registering and managing modules in the agent, similar to course registration in AgilityModule.
-   Created a `Module` interface for all modules to implement, supporting `getName()` and `run()` methods.
-   Updated `Agent` to maintain a registry of modules (`Map<String, Module>`), with methods to register, retrieve, and run modules by name.
-   Registered `AgilityModule` as an example, and updated it to implement the `Module` interface.
-   Ensured all modules (current and future) can be managed and executed in a consistent, extensible way.
-   The agent is now ready for easy addition of new modules and supports dynamic module management.
