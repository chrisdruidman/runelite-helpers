# Step Complete: update-instructions-and-readme-for-scripts

**Date:** 2025-05-14_13-32-53
**Agent:** GitHub Copilot

Updated .github/copilot-instructions.md and README.md to require use of the provided PowerShell scripts for all build, run, and documentation steps. This enforces a robust, script-driven workflow and ensures consistency across patching, building, running, and documenting. Also verified that the scripts work as intended and updated documentation to reflect the new process.
