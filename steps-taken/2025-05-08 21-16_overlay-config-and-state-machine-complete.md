## Step: Integrate overlay configuration and robust state machine for Canifis rooftop automation

-   Fixed overlay UI to allow user configuration of max laps and start/stop controls for agility automation.
-   Updated AgilityModule to expose configuration and control methods for overlay integration.
-   Ensured GameStateService and HookingService are properly injected and modular.
-   Fixed all build and runtime errors related to agent and overlay integration.
-   Confirmed all ASM transformer registration is compatible with the JVM environment.
-   Code is modular, extensible, and ready for further testing and feature development.

You can now configure and control the Canifis rooftop automation from the overlay, with robust error handling and state management.
