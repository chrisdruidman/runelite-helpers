Summary:

-   Investigated and improved menu action matching logic in the agent to allow partial matches for menu option and target, making it robust for in-game variations (e.g., 'Climb Tree...' vs 'Climb Tree').
-   Ensured the agent’s menu action invocation is in line with RuneLite plugin and bot best practices (programmatic, not mouse simulation).
-   Fixed interface implementation and build errors in MenuActionServiceImpl.
-   Clarified the separation of option and target in menu entries, and why the right-click marker does not appear with programmatic invocation.
-   Confirmed that the agent’s approach is standard for RuneLite automation and does not require UI event simulation.
-   User confirmed step completion and requested summary file creation as per project instructions.
