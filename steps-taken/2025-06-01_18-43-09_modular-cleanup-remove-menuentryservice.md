# Step Complete: modular-cleanup-remove-menuentryservice

**Date:** 2025-06-01_18-43-09
**Agent:** Mr. Gippity

Refactored and cleaned up the OSRS Helper Agent codebase for modularity, maintainability, and extensibility. Removed all legacy, unused, and special-case code from agent modules and services. Moved all module-specific logic into modules, ensuring only generic, reusable services remain. Removed all overlay-related code and references. Removed MenuEntryService and AgilityAutomationService, and cleaned up AgentRegistry. Verified that HookingService is still used and required. Codebase now compiles cleanly and is fully modular and registry-driven.
