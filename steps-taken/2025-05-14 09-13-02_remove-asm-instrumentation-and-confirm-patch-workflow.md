# 2025-05-14 09:13:02 Remove ASM/Instrumentation logic and confirm patch-based workflow

**Date:** 2025-05-14 09:13:02
**Agent:** GitHub Copilot (Mr. Gippity)

## Summary

-   Removed all ASM, Instrumentation, and bytecode injection logic from `OverlayInjectionService` and related agent code.
-   Searched the codebase and documentation to ensure no remaining references to ASM, Instrumentation, or bytecode injection.
-   Updated `DummyApi` to provide the required static method for the Dummy Module.
-   Rebuilt the RuneLite client successfully, confirming:
    -   No ASM/Instrumentation/bytecode dependencies remain.
    -   The Dummy Module compiles and works as intended.
-   Patch-based, modular workflow is now clean, robust, and repeatable.

## Next Steps

-   Continue modular development and patch-based tracking for all future changes.
-   Document any new patches and update the changelog/readme in `osrs-helper-patches/` as needed.

**This step completes the migration away from ASM/Instrumentation logic. All agent logic is now integrated via patch files and standard Java code only.**
