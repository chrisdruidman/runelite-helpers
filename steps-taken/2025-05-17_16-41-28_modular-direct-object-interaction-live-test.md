Successfully validated robust, modular, patch-based direct object interaction in RuneLite. The DummyModule, using only the public API and the AgentRegistry, was able to interact with the Canifis start tree in-game, logging success/failure to both the console and in-game chat. This confirms the registry/service pattern and patch-based workflow are working as intended, and the approach is ready for extension to additional modules and automation logic.
