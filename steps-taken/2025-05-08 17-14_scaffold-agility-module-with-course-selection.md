## Step: Scaffold modular Agility helper module with course selection and overlay integration

- Created AgilityCourse interface and CanifisCourse implementation for modular rooftop course support.
- Updated AgilityModule to support course selection, warn if enabled without a course, and provide a configuration panel for the overlay.
- Enhanced OverlayWindow to support module-specific configuration panels, allowing course selection before module activation.
- Ensured all code is modular, extensible, and user-friendly, following project requirements.

This step establishes a robust foundation for Agility module automation and future course extensibility.
