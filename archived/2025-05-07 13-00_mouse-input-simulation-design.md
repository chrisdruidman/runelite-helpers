## Step: Design and Plan Mouse Input Simulation for Agent

-   Decided to implement mouse click simulation as a reusable service at the module level, keeping input logic out of individual course logic.
-   Discussed multiple approaches for simulating mouse input in RuneLite: plugin/EventBus, bytecode injection, JNI/native hooks, and reflection/direct method calls.
-   Determined that, with a custom launcher and shared classloader, reflection and direct method calls are now viable and preferred for most input simulation tasks.
-   Outlined how to use reflection to access RuneLite's internal input handling classes and simulate mouse clicks in the background, without interfering with the user's real mouse.
-   Confirmed that the agent and launcher code should remain modular and extensible, with all input simulation logic centralized for reuse by multiple modules.
