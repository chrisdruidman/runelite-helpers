## Summary

-   Refactored the agent to use a modular, extensible MenuActionService for programmatic menu entry interaction, replacing all mouse simulation logic.
-   Updated the CanifisCourse to provide a mapping of obstacle IDs to their correct menu option and target, allowing the agent to interact with obstacles using the correct right-click menu action.
-   Removed all references to MouseInputService and MouseInputDebugOverlay from the codebase, including their registration, usage, and interface methods.
-   Refactored MenuActionServiceImpl to accept a ServiceRegistry in its constructor for improved dependency management.
-   Fixed access to the CanifisCourse.Obstacle class by making it public static.
-   Cleaned up the HelperModule interface to remove obsolete clickAt and clickGameObject methods.
-   The build is now successful and the agent is ready for further testing and development.
