## Step: Refine Agility Module Click Logic and Humanlike Timing

-   Refined the click logic in MouseInputService to use Perspective.getCanvasTilePoly for agility obstacles, randomizing the click point within the tile polygon for more humanlike and accurate behavior.
-   Updated AgilityModule to randomize the wait time between clicks (1.2s to 3.2s) to better simulate human behavior and allow for in-game animations to complete before the next action.
-   Ensured that Perspective.localToCanvas and related methods are always called at the moment of clicking, never cached, for robust camera and player state handling.
-   Added additional debug logging and error handling to support further troubleshooting and extensibility.

This step improves both the realism and reliability of the automation, and sets a strong foundation for future extensibility and additional modules.
