# Remove Tracked agent-output and launcher-output Files from Git

## Summary

Both `agent-output` and `launcher-output` files were found to be tracked by git in the `osrs-helper-launcher` folder (with `launcher-output` inside a nested subfolder). These files are log outputs and should not be tracked, as they are already included in `.gitignore`.

### Actions Taken

-   Used `git rm --cached` with the correct paths to remove both files from git tracking.
-   Confirmed that these files are now properly ignored and will not be included in future commits.
-   No changes were needed to `.gitignore` as it was already correct.

This ensures that log and build artifacts are not included in the repository, keeping the project clean and following best practices.
