# Patch: modular-cleanup-remove-menuentryservice-2025-06-01_18-43-44

**Created:** 2025-06-01

Removes legacy and unused code, including MenuEntryService and AgilityAutomationService. Refactors the agent registry and modules for full modularity and extensibility. Ensures only generic, reusable services remain. Cleans up overlay and special-case logic.
